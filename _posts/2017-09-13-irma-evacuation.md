Hurricane Irma was forcast to hit Miami and work it's way up the whole state. A lot of people decided to leave and there wasn't really any place to go except north. I live in Gainesville, right on one of the two north-south interstates in the state - I75. Our city runs traffic cameras and the make current images available on a [SmartTraffic](http://gac-smartraffic.com/) site. A few months ago I wrote a script to pull all the images once a minute so I have a history of all the "current" images.

I thought it would be fun to stich them together to make a time-lapse video of the interstate. I started it around Sept 1 so you can see normal traffic, the evacuation rush starts around 9/6, and it runs up until the traffic system crashed at 1:45 am on Monday morning which is about 15 minutes after the peak winds were forcast to hit.
