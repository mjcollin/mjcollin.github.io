Since moving, my commute is along Gainesville's back streets running perpendicular to
main roads. It's quiet if a bit ponderous but there are an enormous number of people
who run red lights at the cross streets. Cellphoners, lemon sqeezers, delivery people,
I see at least 2 a week and I only make 10 trips to and from work.

So I bought a dash cam and installed it this weekend. For your entertainment this 
Tuesday (note it took 2 days to capture my first) here is today's red light runner.

I'll work in putting up a gallery :)

First frame when the light turned green and they're barely even at the stop line and
traveling full speed.

Finally exiting the intersection 3 seconds later.
