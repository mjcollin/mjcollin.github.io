    <h1>Red light runners</h1>
    <p>
    A photo essay of red light runners in Gainesville. I originally intended to take
    one frame that was the state of the intersection when the light turned green but
    I found that often the red light runner was not even in frame yet. I'm trying two or three
    photos now, the first is the frame when the light first turns and the last is the 
    frame when the runner clears the intersection.
