        Prior to returning to private industy, I managed infrastructure for the Advanced Computing and Information Systems Lab (<a href="https://www.acis.ufl.edu/">ACIS</a>) at the University of Florida. My main activity there was <a href="https://www.idigbio.org">iDigBio</a>, an NSF project to digitize museum specimens.
        I have also been a system administrator and developer for the <a href="http://www.flmnh.ufl.edu/">Florida Museum 
        of Natural History at UF</a>, as well as ISPs and consulting companies in my home state 
        of Vermont.
