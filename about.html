        For the last eight years I have managed infrastructure for the Advanced Computing and Information Systems Lab (<a href="https://www.acis.ufl.edu/">ACIS</a>) at the University of Florida. My main activity there has been <a href="https://www.idigbio.org">iDigBio</a>, an NSF project to digitize museum specimens.
        I have also been a system administrator and developer for the <a href="http://www.flmnh.ufl.edu/">Florida Museum 
        of Natural History at UF</a>, as well as ISPs and consulting companies in my home state 
        of Vermont.

        I have 20 years of IT experience focused on open source software and development and I'm currently re-focusing my career on processing data and deriving understanding from them. My <a href="collins_resume.pdf">current resume</a> (industry) or my <a href="collins_cv.pdf">
