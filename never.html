    <h1>Never say...</h1>
    <div>
        <p>
        A collection of things I've heard over the years that I've decided are
        immediate indicators that the speaker has no idea how what they're 
        talking about actually works. It is safe to ignore everything they say 
            after. As always, <a href="https://xkcd.com/1831/">there is a relevent XKCD</a>.
        </p>
        <ul>
            <li>"It's like [Facebook|MySpace|Twitter|Unicorn-de-jour] but better."</li>
            <li>"All it will take is 3 good programmers and six months to do this."</li>
            <li>"We should start with the low hanging fruit"</li>
        </ul>
    </div>
